# FoodSave-Community-Food-Donation-Distribution-Platform
FoodSave is a simple yet impactful web application designed to connect food donors with NGOs/volunteers, helping reduce food wastage and ensuring surplus food reaches people in need. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform functions without a backend by using Local Storage for data management.
